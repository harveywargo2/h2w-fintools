## General Notes

Investing Sucess
> To invest successfully over a lifetime does not require a stratospheric IQ, unusual business insights, or inside information. 
> What’s needed is a sound intellectual framework for making decisions and the ability to keep emotions from corroding that framework. 
> This book precisely and clearly prescribes the proper framework. 
> You must supply the emotional discipline. 
> If you follow the behavioral and business principles that Graham advocates—and if you pay special attention to the invaluable advice in Chapters 8 and 20—you will not get a poor result from your investments. 
> (That represents more of an accomplishment than you might think.) Whether you achieve outstanding results will depend on the effort and intellect you apply to your investments, as well as on the amplitudes of stock-market folly that prevail during your investing career. 
> The sillier the market’s behavior, the greater the opportunity for the business-like investor. 
> Follow Graham and you will profit from folly rather than participate in it.


Price
> If no price seemed too high for stocks in the 1990s, in 2003 we’ve reached the point at which no price appears to be low enough. 
> The pendulum has swung, as Graham knew it always does, from irrational exuberance to unjustifiable pessimism.


Investment Operation
> “An investment operation is one which, upon thorough analysis promises safety of principal and an adequate return. 
> Operations not meeting these requirements are speculative.”


Speculation
> More than that, some speculation is necessary and unavoidable, for in many common-stock situations there are substantial possibilities of both profit and loss, and the risks therein must be assumed by someone.* 
> There is intelligent speculation as there is intelligent investing. 
> But there are many ways in which speculation may be unintelligent. 
> Of these the foremost are: 
> (1) speculating when you think you are investing; 
> (2) speculating seriously instead of as a pastime, when you lack proper knowledge and skill for it; 
> and (3) risking more money in speculation than you can afford to lose.


Speculation
> Never mingle your speculative and investment operations in the same account, nor in any part of your thinking.

 
Defensive Investor
> The defensive investor must confine himself to the shares of important companies with a long record of profitable operations and in strong financial condition. 
> (Any security analyst worth his salt could make up such a list.) 
> Aggressive investors may buy other types of common stocks, but they should be on a definitely attractive basis as established by intelligent analysis.


Results
> We are thus led to the following logical if disconcerting conclusion: 
> To enjoy a reasonable chance for continued better than average results, the investor must follow policies which are 
> - 1 inherently sound and promising, and 
> - 2 not popular on Wall Street


Analysis
>- you must thoroughly analyze a company, and the soundness of its underlying businesses, before you buy its stock; 
>- you must deliberately protect yourself against serious losses; 
>- you must aspire to “adequate,” not extraordinary, performance.


Inflation
> Inflation, and the fight against it, has been very much in the public’s mind in recent years. 
> The shrinkage in the purchasing power of the dollar in the past, and particularly the fear (or hope by speculators) of a serious further decline in the future, has greatly influenced the thinking of Wall Street. 
> It is clear that those with a fixed dollar income will suffer when the cost of living advances, and the same applies to a fixed amount of dollar principal. 
> Holders of stocks, on the other hand, have the possibility that a loss of the dollar’s purchasing power may be offset by advances in their dividends and the prices of their shares.


Inflation 
> Official government policy has been strongly against large-scale inflation, and there are some reasons to believe that Federal policies will be more effective in the future than in recent years.* 
> We think it would be reasonable for an investor at this point to base his thinking and decisions on a probable (far from certain) rate of future inflation of, say, 3% per annum.


Stocks = Businesses
> “Obvious prospects for physical growth in a business do not translate into obvious profits for investors.”

Stocks = Business
> Graham urges you to invest only if you would be comfortable owning a stock even if you had no way of knowing its daily share price.


Margin of Safety, Risk & Diversification
> The intelligent investor realizes that stocks become more risky, not less, as their prices rise—and less risky, not more, as their prices fall. 
> The intelligent investor dreads a bull market, since it makes stocks more costly to buy. 
> And conversely (so long as you keep enough cash on hand to meet your spending needs), you should welcome a bear market, since it puts stocks back on sale.

 
Margin of Safety
> In the ordinary common stock, bought for investment under normal conditions, the margin of safety lies in an expected earning power considerably above the going rate for bonds. 
> In former editions we elucidated this point with the following figures: Assume in a typical case that the earning power is 9% on the price and that the bond rate is 4%; 
> then the stockbuyer will have an average annual margin of 5% accruing in his favor. 
> Some of the excess is paid to him in the dividend rate; 
> even though spent by him, it enters into his overall investment result.


Margin of Safety
> The margin of safety is always dependent on the price paid. 
> It will be large at one price, small at some higher price, nonexistent at some still higher price.


Margin of Safety
> The margin-of-safety idea becomes much more evident when we apply it to the field of undervalued or bargain securities. 
> We have here, by definition, a favorable difference between price on the one hand and indicated or appraised value on the other. 
> That difference is the safety margin.


Margin of Safety
> There is a close logical connection between the concept of a safety margin and the principle of diversification. 
> One is correlative with the other. Even with a margin in the investor’s favor, an individual security may work out badly. 
> For the margin guarantees only that he has a better chance for profit than for loss—not that loss is impossible. 
> But as the number of such commitments is increased the more certain does it become that the aggregate of the profits will exceed the aggregate of the losses. 
> That is the simple basis of the insurance-underwriting business. 
> Diversification is an established tenet of conservative investment. 
> By accepting it so universally, investors are really demonstrating their acceptance of the margin-of-safety principle, to which diversification is the companion.

 
Stock Selection
> Rules for the Common-Stock Component The selection of common stocks for the portfolio of the defensive investor should be a relatively simple matter. 
> Here we would suggest four rules to be followed: 
> 1. There should be adequate though not excessive diversification. This might mean a minimum of ten different issues and a maximum of about thirty.† 
> 2. Each company selected should be large, prominent, and conservatively financed. Indefinite as these adjectives must be, their general sense is clear. Observations on this point are added at the end of the chapter. 
> 3. Each company should have a long record of continuous dividend payments. (All the issues in the Dow Jones Industrial Average met this dividend requirement in 1971.) To be specific on this point we would suggest the requirement of continuous dividend payments beginning at least in 1950.* 
> 4. The investor should impose some limit on the price he will pay for an issue in relation to its average earnings over, say, the past seven years. We suggest that this limit be set at 25 times such average earnings, and not more than 20 times those of the last twelve-month period. But such a restriction would eliminate nearly all the strongest and most popular companies from the portfolio. In particular, it would ban virtually the entire category of “growth stocks,” which have for some years past been the favorites of both speculators and institutional investors. We must give our reasons for proposing so drastic an exclusion.

 
Stock Selection
> Since common stocks, even of investment grade, are subject to recurrent and wide fluctuations in their prices, the intelligent investor should be interested in the possibilities of profiting from these pendulum swings. 
> There are two possible ways by which he may try to do this: the way of timing and the way of pricing. 
> By timing we mean the endeavor to anticipate the action of the stock market—to buy or hold when the future course is deemed to be upward, to sell or refrain from buying when the course is downward. 
> By pricing we mean the endeavor to buy stocks when they are quoted below their fair value and to sell them when they rise above such value. 
> A less ambitious form of pricing is the simple effort to make sure that when you buy you do not pay too much for your stocks. 
> This may suffice for the defensive investor, whose emphasis is on long-pull holding; 
> but as such it represents an essential minimum of attention to market levels.
